# Statistics And Proability

Statistics and Probabilty are the foundation for all the fancy machine learning, deep learning and AI algorithms out there. A good data scinetist must master this to contribute to the fast paced research in the field of data science.    

**Just a good to know fact**    
The problems considered by probability and statistics are inverse to each other.  

In probability theory we consider some underlying process which has some randomness or uncertainty modeled by random variables, and we figure out what happens.   

In statistics we observe something that has happened, and try to figure out what underlying process would explain those observations.  

Here in this repository I will be discussing statistics and probability related topics using using R and Python
