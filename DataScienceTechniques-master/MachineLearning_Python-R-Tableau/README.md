# MachineLearning_Python-R-Tableau

This repository has a unique purpose and format specially addressed for viewers who want to take a peek into the real world data science projects that I have done in the analytics industry.

We all know that the client's information, data and projects are confidential. So I will not be able to share any specific details of Client, project or data.

What I will be trying here is to pick a closest project on Kaggle that resembles to the project that I have done for a client and building a high level analytical solution to the problem, similar to what I had built for my client.

The projects that I have chosen from Kaggle will not be the exact project that I solved for my client and stakeholders. But it will have some flavours of it

Welcome to my world of data science. Let us together make this world a better place using the power of Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Artificial Intelligence.
