# DeepLearning-ArtificialIntelligence_ScikitLearn-TensorFlow


In this repository you can learn how to implement Deep neural network using Tensor Flow and Scikit learn. I have also tried focusing on math behind things wherever it is necessary for a datascientist to understand so that he/she can interpret and improve the model

The whole reason for this repository is because of my love for TensorFlow, ScikiLearn and Python. I'm excited to learn every day and keep pushing the boundaries of machine learning, deep learning and AI. I also would like to thank Aurelien Geron , without his book Handson ml wit SKLearn and Tensor Flow. I couldnt have been so clear with the concepts of Deep learning and with the way DNN is implemented in production scale at big companies such as google.
